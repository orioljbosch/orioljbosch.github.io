As a survey methodologist, I am not only experienced and interested in academic research, but also in solving real-world problems.

My expertise can be divided into three areas: 1) mobile and web surveys; 2) questionnaire design and measurement quality and 3) sampling design and assessment.
1. I have expertise in assessing, designing, and fielding web and mobile surveys. From 2016 to 2018, I collaborated with the online opt-in panel Netquest as a member of the [Netquest Research lab](https://www.netquest.com/netquest-research-lab), exploring ways to improve the way data is collected through web surveys and discover new approaches to implement advanced Data Science methods for contemporary online research. Besides, I have collaborated with the [CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/methodological_research/modes_of_data_collection/cronos.html) panel, exploring ways to improve panelist responding behaviour.
2. I particularly focus on estimating the measurement quality of survey questions by means of Multitrait-Multimethod (MTMM) experiments. From 2017 to 2018 I worked with the [European Social Survey-Core Scientific Team](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/european-social-survey-ees-eric-core-scientific-team-cst-2008-ongoing-) assessing the quality of their survey questions. Drawing from this expertise, I can help to develop and improve questionnaires, to obtain high-quality data.
3. As a Research Officer at the [Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/), I collaborated with Prof. Peter Lynn assessing the sampling design of Round 7, 8 and 9 of the European Social Survey. Besides, I have worked as a consultant for the [Money Advice Service](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en), helping them develop a longitudinal survey of people in debt.

Apart from these experiences, I often collaborate with [LSE consulting](http://www.lse.ac.uk/business-and-consultancy/consulting), helping them prepare bids for tender opportunities.

I am always **open to collaborate on new projects and help design and implement high-quality surveys**. If you are interested in collaborating with me, [contact me](mailto:o.bosch-jover@lse.ac.uk).
