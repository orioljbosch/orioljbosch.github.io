Hi there! I am a [Postdoctoral researcher](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Oriol-Bosh-Jover/Oriol-Bosch-Jover) in Data Donation and Computational Methods at the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](https://www.demography.ox.ac.uk/) and [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/). I am also a [Non-Resident Researcher](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/entry/-/-/U91787/adscripcion/oriol-bosch) at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). I got my PhD in Social Research Methods from the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

My work and research
======

As a (survey) computational  methodologist, I specialise in the use of survey and computational methods to understand how scientists can best collect and analyse new sources of data, such as digital trace data. I focus on topics related to web and mobile surveys and the use of digital trace data and sensors to enhance or substitute surveys. My work has been published in journals such as Social Science Computer Review or the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Currently my work focuses on how social scientists can best collect information about citizens’ online behaviours using data donation and web trackers. Through a combination of survey and computational methods, my research explores how to quantify and minimize digital trace data errors, while comparing them with the ones of surveys. In my current role in Oxford, I am working on the development of a state-of-the-art data donation infrastructure.

One of the best things about being a methodologist is being able to collaborate across disciplines and help projects thrive. That has allowed me to participate in several international research projects, such as the [ERC’S WEB DATA OPP project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/849165), [TRI-POL](https://www.upf.edu/web/tri-pol), [GenPopWeb2 network](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/research/genpopweb2/), [Netquest Research Lab](https://www.netquest.com/netquest-research-lab) and the [CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/methodological_research/modes_of_data_collection/cronos.html). Apart from my academic background, I enjoy doing consulting projects for non-profit organisations and public bodies. So far I have collaborated with the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/), the [
Social Care Institute for Excellence](https://www.scie.org.uk/) and [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en), helping them better design and analyse socially relevant surveys.
