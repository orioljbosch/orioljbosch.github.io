Hi there! I am a fourth year [PhD candidate](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Oriol-Bosh-Jover/Oriol-Bosch-Jover) at the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), a Research Assistant at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) and a [Non-Resident Researcher](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/entry/-/-/U91787/adscripcion/oriol-bosch) at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). 

My work and research
======
As a methodologist, I focus on understanding how to better collect and analyse attitudinal and behavioural data for the social sciences. I specialize in topics related to web and mobile surveys and the use of digital trace data and sensors to enhance or substitute surveys. My work, published in journals such as Social Science Computer Review or the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, has explored the measurement quality of survey scales in online surveys using [MTMM experiments](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439317750089); the [generational divides]( https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1470785318815567) between participants in terms of survey behaviour and data quality; and the impact on data quality of using novel data types to answer survey questions such as [images](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12856), [voice memos](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439318810715) and [emojis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-020-00994-8). 

For my PhD, I am focusing on understanding how social scientists can best collect information about citizens’ online behaviours using web trackers, e.g., apps that can track the URLs and apps through that individuals visit. Through a combination of [theory](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12956) and traditional survey and [computational methods](https://orioljbosch.com/talks/2022-AAPOR-Validity), my research explores how to quantify and minimize metered data errors, while comparing them with the ones of surveys. 

One of the best things about being a methodologist is being able to collaborate across disciplines and help projects thrive. That has allowed me to participate in several international research projects, such as the [ERC’S WEB DATA OPP project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/849165), [TRI-POL](https://www.upf.edu/web/tri-pol), [GenPopWeb2 network](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/research/genpopweb2/), [Netquest Research Lab](https://www.netquest.com/netquest-research-lab) and the [CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/methodological_research/modes_of_data_collection/cronos.html). Apart from my academic background, I enjoy doing consulting projects for non-profit organisations and public bodies. So far I have collaborated with the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/), the [
Social Care Institute for Excellence](https://www.scie.org.uk/) and [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en), helping them better design and analyse socially relevant surveys.
