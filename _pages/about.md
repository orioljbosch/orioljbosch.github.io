Hi there! I am a [PhD candidate](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Research-Students/Oriol-Bosh-Jover/Oriol-Bosch-Jover) at the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a [Non-Resident Researcher](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey/entry/-/-/U91787/adscripcion/oriol-bosch) at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). I hold a BA in Political Science from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and an MSc in Survey Methods for Social Research from the University of Essex. Previously I worked as a Research Assistant at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/socsci/index.page) and a Research Officer at the [Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER)](https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/) at the University of Essex.

My work and research
======
As a  methodologist, I focus on understanding how to better collect and analyse attitudinal and behavioural data for the social sciences. I specialize in topics related to measurement quality, web and mobile surveys and the use of digital trace data and sensors/apps to enhance or substitute surveys, and the effect of these on data quality. Specifically, my work has explored the impact on data quality of using novel data types to answer survey questions as [images](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439318791515), [voice memos](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439318810715) and [emojis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-020-00994-8). For my PhD, I am developing a [framework](https://www.upf.edu/documents/3966940/6839730/WP62.pdf/16aaf443-c545-2f5a-faac-a2bb55dec4d6) for combining web tracking data (also known as metered data, digital trace data, web log data or online behavioural data) and survey data. Moreover, I have expertise in the use and design of [MultiTrait-MultiMethod (MTMM) experiments](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439317750089) to disentangle the measurement quality of survey questions, and how to improve their design.

One of the best things about being a methodologist is being able to collaborate across disciplines and help projects thrive. That has allowed me to participate in several international research projects, such as the [ERCâ€™S WEB DATA OPP project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/849165), [TRI-POL](https://www.upf.edu/web/tri-pol), [GenPopWeb2 network](https://www.ncrm.ac.uk/research/genpopweb2/), [Netquest Research Lab](https://www.netquest.com/netquest-research-lab) and the [CROss-National Online Survey (CRONOS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/methodological_research/modes_of_data_collection/cronos.html). I also have had the pleasure to work with the [European Social Survey (ESS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) analysing the quality of their survey questions and their sampling design. Apart from my academic background, I enjoy doing conuslting projects for non-profit organisations and public bodies. So far I have collaborated with the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/), the [
Social Care Institute for Excellence](https://www.scie.org.uk/) and [MoneyHelper](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en), helping them better design and analyse socially relevant surveys.
