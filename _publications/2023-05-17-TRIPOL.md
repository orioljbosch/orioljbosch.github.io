_Abstract_:The TRI-POL project explores the triangle of interactive relationships between affective and ideological polarisation, political distrust, and the politics of party competition. In this project there are two complementary groups of datasets with individual-level survey data and digital trace data collected in five countries: Argentina, Chile, Italy, Portugal and Spain. These datasets are comprised of three waves carried out over a six-month period between late September 2021 and April 2022. In addition, the survey datasets include a series of experiments embedded in the different waves that examine social exposure, polarisation framing, and social sorting. The digital trace datasets include variables on individualsâ€™ behaviours and exposure to information received via digital media and social media. This data was collected using a combination of tracking technologies that the interviewees installed in their different devices. This digital trace data is matched with the individual-level survey data. These datasets are especially useful for researchers who wish to explore dynamics of polarisation, political attitudes, and political communication.
