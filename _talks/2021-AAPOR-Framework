_Description_: Metered data (also called “web log data”, “digital trace data”, “web-tracking data” or “passive data”) is a type of Big Data obtained from a meter willingly installed or configured by participants on their devices (PCs, tablets and/or smartphones). A meter refers to a heterogeneous group of tracking technologies that allow sharing with the researchers, at least, information about the URLs of the web pages visited by the participants. Depending on the technology used, HTML, time or device information can also be collected. Metered data is objective, free of human memory limitations and produced in real-time. Therefore, metered data has a great potential to replace part of survey data or to be combined with survey data to obtain a more complete picture of reality. Metered data, nevertheless, needs to be used properly. It is crucial to understand its limitations to mitigate potential errors. To date, some research has explored potential error causes of metered data. However, a systematic categorization and conceptualization of these errors is missing.
Therefore, in this presentation, we present a framework of all errors that can occur when using metered data. We adapt the Total Survey Error (TSE) framework (Groves et al., 2009) to accommodate it to the specific error generating processes and error causes of metered data. The adapted error framework shows how the unique characteristics of metered data can affect data quality, but also allows comparing metered data errors with survey errors, since it is based on the TSE framework. Hence, the adapted framework can be useful when using metered data alone or in combination with surveys, to choose the best design options for metered data, but also to make better informed decisions while planning when and how to supplement or replace survey data with metered data.
