_Abstract_: Relatively little is known about the micro- level dynamics of over-indebtedness and
associated social, health and other outcomes, and the role of formal debt advice in
this process. To rectify this, a large- scale longitudinal survey has been proposed.
However, such a survey would face several challenges, notably in sample recruitment
and retention and in statistical identification of the effects of debt advice. A medium -
scale pilot survey was carried out in order to test survey procedures and obtain
estimates of key parameters that would determine the sample size and design of the
main survey. This paper reports the findings of the pilot.
