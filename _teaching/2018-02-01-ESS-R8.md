_Abstract_: In Round 8 of the European Social Survey (ESS) a Split-Ballot True-Score Multitrait-Multimethod (SB-TS-MTMM) experiment was conducted to evaluate the measurement quality of nine survey questions. This report first presents the data used. Then, measurement quality is defined, and the experimental SB-TS-MTMM approach used to evaluate it is presented. Finally, we report the results of the experiment and discuss the differences in measurement quality of the responses for the different experimental conditions and by countries.
